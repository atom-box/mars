# V2.0  Tournament.py   November 18, 2017
This program was completed for the Udacity Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses  It was written by Evan Genest  This program dynamically updates a Swiss-Style bracket for a live tournament. I used (1) PostGRESQL, (2) Vagrant v.m., (3) Python for the server queries.

General Usage Notes
-----------------------
1.  Requires installing (a) PostgreSQL and (b) psycops2 package for Python
2.  Start by running the sql setup:     $psql tournament
3.  Then run: python tournament_test.py  This will call each of the functions in the tournament.py module.



Description of the database
-----------------------

The database has two initial tables:

name | player_id      match_id  |  winner_id  |  loser_id 
		 | (KEY)      		(KEY)		  |  						| 
==============				====================================
		 |													|							|

Seven(!) views are generated by the program.   
I did this to maximize readability and ease of altering the details.  
If I had to release this for use, I would condense these into just two views.
